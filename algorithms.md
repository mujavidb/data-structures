Types of binary tree traversal:

* Breadth-first
    - Level-order
* Deapth-first
    - Preoder
    - Inorder
    - Postorder

In each of the deapth-first searches of binary trees root, right and left nodes are visited in different orders.
- Preoder   -> **<root>** <left> <right>
- Inorder   -> <left> **<root>** <right>
- Postorder -> <left> <right> **<root>**

Time: O(n)
Space: O(h)
